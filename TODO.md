next# TODO: Improve React Hooks React Router Nested Routes v6 Project

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Restructure routes in `src/routes.js` to include nested routes (e.g., `/users` as parent with `/users/:id` as child).
- [x] Move NavBar into `src/App.js` as a global layout using `Outlet` for nested rendering.
- [x] Add state and submit handler to Login form in `src/pages/Login.js`.
- [x] Implement loading state in Home component (`src/pages/Home.js`).
- [x] Implement loading state in UserProfile component (`src/pages/UserProfile.js`).
- [x] Enhance ErrorPage with more details and consistent styling (`src/pages/ErrorPage.js`).
- [x] Update components to use the new layout (remove NavBar from Home.js if needed).
- [x] Minor updates to NavBar.js for consistency if required.
- [x] Test the application: Run dev server, navigate routes, verify nested routes, form submission, loading states, and check for errors.
